# Groupie

A better LFG tool for Classic WoW.

<br>

### :gem:  **KEY FEATURES**

:one:  Quickly find the groups you actually want to be in. You can filter groups by group-size, loot rules type, language, and more. Groupie is smart enough to hide dungeons out of your level range, and heroics or raids that you're already saved to.

:two:  One-click ability to share your character's role, key stats, and relevant achievement link with the group's leader. For group leaders, this means no more context-less "wants to join" pop-ups from the Blizzard LFG Tool, or random "inv" responses to your posts.

:three:  Coming Soon! Optional ability to auto-respond to Friends and Guildies when they post groups that you are interested in. So let's say you're sitting around scanning the AH, and a friend posts "LFM Heroic Nexus," you can have Groupie set to auto-respond, or simply play a sound notifying you there's a group created by someone in your network.

Some other stuff worth mentioning...

* Groupie shares its data between all of your characters on a server. If you happen to see a group you want to do on a different character, you can switch over and you'll still see the post.

* Groupie has built-in spoof protection. If someone sends you an Achievement Link in a Groupie Message, you can trust it's not a fake -- as long as you also have Groupie installed.

* Coming Soon! Groupie Global Friends & Ignores List. This allows you to find guildies or friends from your other characters, and avoid the shady folks. 

* Coming Soon! Groupie's "After Party" Tool. This will be an optional prompt window so you can quickly add people you enjoyed running with to your Groupie Global Friends & Ignores List.
