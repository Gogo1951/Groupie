# Groupie

A better LFG tool for Classic WoW.

<br>

### :gem:  **KEY FEATURES**

<br>

* Quickly find the groups you actually want to be in. You can filter groups by group-size, loot rules type, language, and more. Groupie is smart enough to hide dungeons out of your level range, and heroics or raids that you're already saved to.

* One-click ability to share your character's role, key stats, and relevant achievement link with the group's leader. For group leaders, this means no more context-less "wants to join" pop-ups from the Blizzard LFG Tool, or random "inv" responses to your posts.

* Coming Soon! Ability to Send Your Character Sheet in a Message. You'll be able to virtually inspect Groupie users from anywhere in the world before you invite them to your PUG.

* Coming Soon! Global Friends & Ignore List, & optional ability to Auto-Respond to Friends and Guildies when they post groups that you are interested in.

<br>

Some other stuff worth mentioning...

* Groupie shares its data between all of your characters on a server. If you happen to see a group you want to do on a different character, you can switch over and you'll still see the post.

* Groupie has built-in spoof protection. If someone sends you an Achievement Link in a Groupie Message, you can trust it's not a fake -- as long as you also have Groupie installed.

* If you're someone who just wants to play the game, Groupie does a pretty good job of filtering all of the "boost" spam to the "Other" Tab on the Bulletin Board.

* Coming Soon! Groupie's "After Party" Tool. This will be an optional prompt window so you can quickly add people you enjoyed running with to your Groupie Global Friends & Ignores List.
